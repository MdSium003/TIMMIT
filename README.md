TIMMIT
A Never Ending Journey
By Team_Ghumay_Gese

In our game, inspired by the theme 'Heroes never die,' the protagonist's greed traps him in an infinite time loop. What initially seems like a blessing—immortality—soon reveals itself as a curse. Unable to die or escape the loop, he is forced to relive the same moments over and over, with no way out. His heroic stature fades as he confronts the consequences of his selfishness, turning his eternal life into a prison. The game explores themes of greed, consequence, and the futility of avoiding fate.

TIMMIT was developed primarily for gamejam in a very short amount of time. We apologize for any inconvenience, but there may be too many bugs. However, we have made an effort to address issues and provide you with an excellent experience.
